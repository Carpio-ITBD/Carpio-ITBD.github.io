        <!--USING NON BREAKING SPACE-->
        <p>&nbsp; This is a sample parapgraph. A paragraph is a distinct section of writing covering one topic. A paragraph will usually contain more than one sentence. A typical paragraph will be 5-7 sentences, but this is by no means a rule. The length of a paragraph is determined by the topic and the content. The "perfect" paragraph will start with a topic sentence. It will have detail sentences in the middle and end with a concluding sentence. It will only cover one topic from start to finish.</p>
