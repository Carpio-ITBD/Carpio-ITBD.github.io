                    My all time favorite series! One of the most well known anime/manga and one of the OG Anime of Shounen. This incredible series is what got me to both watch anime and read manga. This series has opened an unimaginable new world to me and for that I will forever be grateful. 
                    <br><br>
                    This series is full of valuable life lessons. There are obvious big ones that drives the series like Never Giving Up and Friendship. But as I have rewatched this series multiple times as I grew up, it was apparent there's an incredible amount of underlying lessons and topics that as a kid/child reading this, will be too young to understand that it's even there. Topics like war and peace, and politics, and relationships. Frankly, it is mind boggling on how much realism there is inside this Fantasy novel. Overall, this is the opposite of a Hidden Gem, a Gem out in the Open, beautiful, and everlasting, and will forever be my all time favorite.

                    This is a very popular series right now as of writing this due to the just finished airing of the anime adaptation and the incredible reception to it as a whole. And I'm not surprised, as a Manga reader of this series that had followed this series when it was very early on, I know for a fact how incredible the writing and artwork the Mangaka of this series had done. It is phenomenal. I am an avid reader of slice of life romance Manga so I have read dozens of those genres up to now, and this series still manages to blow me away in awe. This is the best romance series that I am following right now. There is no other way to say it. It has an incredible story, incredible art, and nice pacing that suits my taste. It is awesome and would definitely recommend it even if you're not a manga reader or new to this stuff.

                    Not really a manga but a variation of it called a Webtoon. Webtoon is a comic intended to be read using a handheld touch device, mostly smartphones, scrolling down vertically rather than just reading a per page content like a traditional printed book. This being a content made to be consumed digitally, it opens up a new experience that capitalizes on the fact that it can hold any colors and much more details than traditional manga.comics. That being said, the thing as to why I recommend this is because I wholeheartedly think of this as the best webtoon there is. The story is very well written, but more than that, the most incredible thing about this series is the uniqueness of the art and how incredible it is to look like. Webtoons tend to have a similar look in art style, and no matter how good looking they are, their lack of uniqueness can sometimes be detrimental. Once you read this webtoon, you will see what I'm talking about and no doubt come to the same conclusion as well. This is one of the most underrated series there is, definitely an underdog that more people should start reading.

                <p style="height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll;">

                    t has been a long time since I read this manga, but I know for a fact that this is a spectacular of a series, enough to get it an anime adaptation and get an incredible reception to it. For me, what sets Made in Abyss apart from the rest is the incredible artstyle. Now don’t get me wrong, the story itself is incredible, with lots of details, good pacing, thrilling adventure and such, but the art by the mangaka of this series is legitimately breathtaking, and there's no other words to describe it. From the paneling to the amount of details is incredible and it just sucks you into the fantasy world setting of this series. It happened to me the first time I  saw this manga, I didn’t even hesitate to read it. And the next thing I know, I am feeling emotions that are usually unwanted. Yes, the story of this series is so spectacular that it will make you feel down to your heart. I may have said that the art is what differentiates this series from the rest but the story is what really makes this manga an incredible series. Fare warning for those who want a happy go lucky vibe when they’re reading something, this is not for you. If you are not, then I highly recommend reading this manga.
