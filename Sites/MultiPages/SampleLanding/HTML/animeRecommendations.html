                    My all time favorite series! I have already written my thoughts on this series as a manga, so this time, I will focus on what makes it my all time favorite series as an Anime. As an anime that started two decades ago, it ran for a long long time until it finally released its final episode back in 2017. As a long running series, this has lots of ups and downs especially in the first part of the series in the early 2000s. Back then where each frame was literally drawn in paper, scanned, and colored one by one, so when there are times when there's not much budget and/or time, the quality suffers where some episodes run on like 12 frames per second. But those were the low-low. When it counts this series knows how to make it really count. Like real count. Even back in those times of handmade animations, when it comes to the real good episodes, this series knows how to put effort into it for the fans, and that's what I think puts it in the Hall of Fame of the greatest series of all time. If they know the episode will be a big one, they are not afraid to put their resources into it, even if other episodes suffer. They will take several months just to make a 20 minute episode and it will be worth it as those episodes and scenes really made a mark in history as the best of its class and still holds even now 2 decades after. 

                    But the biggest strength of this anime is in the music. I have watched an incredible amount of anime in the past years, and nothing, and I mean nothing comes close to the quality of the songs in this series. From the openings, endings, to the Original Sound Tracks, they are incredible to the point that they are legit on my playlist because they are as incredible to listen to on their own as they are paired with the animation. The music in this series does so much that if the animation is in the lowpoint like I said earlier, the music will manage to lift it up to be bearable. It's that good.

                    A very unique anime/film in my opinion, or at the very least is very different from what I'm used to back when I first watched this anime. This is an anime film that is separated into three parts. Each part reflects a phase of life: childhood, teenage years, adulthood. This focuses on the daily life and relationship of two individuals and this anime takes a very realistic, probably the most realistic take on the genre romance that I have ever seen on anime even now. The story is very simple and realistic but the direction is on a whole level. This anime takes pride in its animation quality, including sound design and camera direction. The direction of this film is so incredible that it holds its own as one of the best anime films ever produced even to this day. Each scene is so beautiful that it legit can be made into a wallpaper, which I have done multiple times. The incredible direction and animation quality this film had can be said to have set the bar for independent modern anime film that we all enjoy today.

                    One of the most acclaimed anime / anime films of all time. When you ask someone what anime would they recommend for first time watchers, they would probably recommend Ghibli Films, and among those films, this will probably be the first most common recommendation of them all. Directed by the renowned Hayao Miyazaki, this film started in 2000 and was released one year later. This has a running time of 124 minutes at 24 frames per second, this film nearly has 180 thousand frames. Why am I saying this? Because as you may have realized, being created in the year 2000, each frame on this film was hand drawn on paper by dozens of people in an office with literally sweat and tears, countless hours of overtime, this film is the materialization of literal hardwork of people. Even each background use is a literal painting by artists. This process can be said as well to every single Ghibli Film but what set this film apart from the rest is the incredible reception from the western audience. This is one of the most acclaimed animated films of all time, not just an anime, world wide. This is backed by the very solid evidence of it being the highest grossing anime film of all time even now, two whole decades after it was released. It's a very incredible film with outstanding direction, music, and animation, that anyone, regardless of age, will surely enjoy.

                    In today's world where there's literally thousands of anime to choose from for people to watch, this one is a hidden gem among them all. This anime, as far as I know, is quite unknown even to your average anime watcher today. A lot of my friends who watch as much anime as I do haven't even heard of this title until I told it to them. This anime is about a future, which I want to say, in my own humble opinion, is probably the future we are heading to. I don't want to talk about it much because it might spoil, but to give a quick synopsis without spoiling, this is about human cohabitating with androids, that literally looks like humans, made available commercially for people to buy to help on daily chores and jobs. This film is very serious, very realistic, and very focused on the political, cultural, traditional issues and very heavy on the morality and ethical sides of the current time the movie takes place in. It's a hidden gem of a drama that is a pleasure to watch because of the uniqueness of its story and even now, I haven't seen an anime that takes a similar idea of a story and that's why I highly recommend people watching this little treasure.

                    Taking place in the modern world, this incredible series is full of what makes a good anime a good anime. This is a sort of a mystery show with a side of thriller and modern fiction. Without spoiling too much, I would try to explain what this anime is all about and that's actually kind of hard because of how unique the story of this anime is. Have you ever wished you could do anything you want? What if you could? but with a cause. Through an interlocking web of political and financial connections, this anime shows a very realistic world through an unrealistic plot. I know that's an irony, but that's the best way I can describe it. This anime shows how important connections are and how deep it really goes behind the forefront that the public usually shows. This anime shows a very balanced story consisting of action, mystery, drama, friendship, and sacrifice. This show has one of the most unique stories that you will ever find and they executed it perfectly. This was a thrill to watch and honestly, I didn't even notice I was going to finish it because I just binge watched it all non stop until I was at the very end. It's one of those series that no matter how long it had been and how many more anime I have watched, I just couldn't forget the title nor the story because it's that just impactful and memorable.
