                    Ah yes, reincarnated as a slime. Probably one of the most famous Isekai now because of the successful anime and manga. This series right here is one of the very first web novels I have read. And now, I am currently reading the light novel version which is a much much better version, which is not surprising because light novels have official editors and will be the one that will actually be printed and sold on bookshelves, so the quality must be high in order for the series to sell, and believe me, it is selling well, with even spin off series doing well too! For those who don't know, Isekai is a tag usually refers to a story of being Reincarnated, Transmigrated, or Reborn, to another world, usually a world of swords and magic, usually paired with a medieval like Era of technology, culture, and tradition. The reason I not only like but also love the novel of this series, specially this light novel version, is the quality and amount of writing it gives not just to the story but also the character development and kingdom building aspect of the story and the author manage to get an unbelievably perfect balance between them all and not just the character development of the main hero but every single main and side character gets the perfect amount of story time. What's more is that if anything, any Isekai reader out there knows that the genre tends to give the MC the overpowered treatment, and this novel is no exception to that. But the good thing is that among all other Isekai stories I know, this novel handles OP characters in the best way that it's actually fun to read and not annoying. Definitely one of the best Isekai Novels there is and I highly recommend it to any Isekai or Fantasy lovers out there.

                    Another Isekai novel but with a twist. I won't tell what that twist is because it's a spoiler but that's okay because that's not the focus of this novel. The focus of this novel is probably my most beloved genre of them all: KINGDOM BUILDING. Kingdom Building, as the name suggests, is any story that revolves around the premise of managing and building a city, country, or any territory, even sometimes, just a business company, etc. This novel revolves heavily on War Tactics, Political Battles, Economic Importance, etc. It's honestly so good that you will learn things that not even school can teach you properly because you are learning this due to the showcase of scenarios in the novel. The novel manages a perfect balance between all these aspects of stories and character development of not just the main character but also the side characters and the relationship between them from love partners to family to friends. But among all of those, another thing that I found incredible is War Tactics and Military battles between Armies of different factions and countries. Overall, if you want those kinds of tags, I definitely recommend this one!

                    One of my all time favorites. You want something wholesome, heartwarming, and an incredible slice of life story? Then look no further than this one. This is a story of a man getting Isekai'd but unlike other Isekai full of death battles and wars and other forms of conflict, this one focuses on the opposite. Yes it still has some conflicts and such, but those are minor events and what this series is mostly about is our main character experiencing the goods of relationship, love and care, for the first time. This is a story of an MC and his relations and eventually, hopefully, finding what it means to have Self Love and Self care. This is literally one of the most wholesome and heartwarming things I have ever read and it was quite surprising to find it in an Isekai no less. I don't really have much to say about this other than the fact that I truly recommend reading this series, it'll be worth your time :)

                    This is one of the best japanese Sci-Fi novels there is.... or atleast the only one ongoing of its kind. This is a story of a man being isekai'd into the universe that instead of swords and magic, it's the science fiction dream of Spaceships and Inter galactic empires and such. This series is basically a comedy full of actions and exploration of a new modern era for our MC with his lovely harem of girls that grows as his journey continues. A life of danger, romance, and money, this is legit one of the most unique stories I have ever found in its kind that I would say its the only one of its kind there is. There are other sci fi space novels there but none really captures the atmosphere that this series does. As a novel, it's very fun and easy to read. I have read this as a web novel. Currently there is a light novel version but only comes up to 4 arcs, each arc having one volume out. Which means I can only write a review based on the web novel version, which as a self-published series, have a lot of, not really errors, but let's just say "holes'', which I hope they will address with the light novels, though I will only find out once I read those. Overall, this is a novel so unique that it's very much on its own, earning itself a recommendation from me.

                    Oh where do I start with this one. This is a self-published web novel self-published by the author Manasong. This story is also an Isekai. Tho a very unique one. That is because of two things. First is that the amount of details in this series is incredibly insane. I have read a lot of Isekai and Fantasy novels and this is the most detailed of them all and it's not even published on print and sold on bookshelves. The second one, is that half of the story, is sexual content. Yes, this is basically what people call "porn with a plot" on the internet. If you like those, then give this one a read. This is an incredible story for a self-published novel and frankly, quite surprising that no publisher had shown interest in making prints considering the fact that this has millions of views on various self-publishing sites where the author uploaded it to.
