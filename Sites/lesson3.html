    <p>&nbsp; Naruto (Japanese: <mark>NARUTOナルト</mark>) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: <cite>Karakuri (1995)</cite>, which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and <cite>Naruto (1997)</cite>.</p>
