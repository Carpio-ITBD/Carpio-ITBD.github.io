<div name="divOpening" class="side">
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Greetings to anyone who may be reading this right now. This is my autobiography. Meaning I will tell you my story from the earliest memory I can remember, to my current life as when I am writing this right now. Now before we start, allow me to write this essay in a very informal manner. This is the style I am most comfortable with and I think I can express myself more this way. This may be long, or unexpectedly short. It’ll depend on how you perceive my writing, whether it’ll be to your liking or not. If you just skip a lot of it, hey, I get it, I’m like that too, so no worries there. If you manage to read it all the way, congratulations, you receive my thanks as a reward.

    <h2>CHILDHOOD</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me begin my story from June 26, 2000. The setting is in Cabanatuan City, in the province of Nueva Ecija<sup>1</sup>. My father is Randy Carpio, my Mother Joylin Vinarao. On this day, they both became parents as I was born. They were not married yet at this point. They got to do so shortly after, before filing my birth certificate.They gave me the name John Randel, so my full name is John Randel Vinarao Carpio. After my first birthday, my family moved here in Manila. Specifically, in the area called Barrio Obrero here in Tondo, quite near the border of Caloocan. We shared a house with the family of my Father’s aunt. From the stories my parents told me, this area we lived in was quite chaotic. Snatchers, drunkards, fights left and right. But I remember none of this. Then again, that was to be expected as I was just a baby back then. After a few years, we ended up moving to an apartment owned by a distant relative of ours. This was in the same area just a few streets away from the previous house. Ofcourse, we shared the apartment too with the family of my father’s aunt. They are the closest family relative we have and I grew up knowing them as just part of the family. Most of my childhood memories that I remember start here. In 2005, I was enrolled in kindergarten by my parents and had my baby little brother. I don't remember much from this time because I was only 5. I do remember that my classmate mistakenly took my lunch thinking it was theirs. June of 2006, I was enrolled in elementary school, first grade. I don’t remember much from this as well. I do remember my teacher here. She was a kind old woman who helped me a lot of times growing up. Around this time, my father decided to work abroad for better pay. We’re quite poor, so in order for me to go to school, my father decided to work abroad. Second grade, I don’t remember much as well. Third grade, the only thing I remember is this was when we finally got our first console, a Gameboy Advance SP<sup>2</sup>, complete with two cartridges, 101 games in one, and Digimon. It was so cool that even my grand uncle who was living with us started borrowing it as well to play Super Mario Bros. We play this so much that it became a prominent part of my childhood. Later on, we also bought another cartridge, Pokemon FireRed<sup>3</sup> and Naruto Ninja Scroll. Thinking now, it really was funny because I had no idea what these two were when my Mom bought it. But these two series, Pokemon and Naruto, became such a big part of not just my childhood, but my entire life up to now. I know that I was very happy playing both of the two newly bought games. Like I do not know any of these and just played through. Like when my Charmeleon evolved into Charizard, I remember running to my Mom as she was washing the dishes, saying “Ma, may dragon na ako oh!”. It was really funny thinking back to it. When I reached grade 5, I joined the journalism team of our school. I don’t know what it was back then but my teacher basically  forced the top 10 of the class to just be part of it. I don’t really know what that is but when we were picking what roles we wanted to take, like writing articles, writing opinions, this is when I learned about editorial cartooning. I like to draw so I picked that role. And it also means I won't be writing long paragraphs of articles and such. Writing this now, I didn’t realize I was already this lazy back then. We entered the city wide contest for this but none of us actually won. I just remember that I was excited to go home the day of the contest because it’s the premier of Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension. Phineas and Ferb<sup>4</sup> is my favorite cartoon of all time even now, I watched that series like it was my religion when I was young. Probably because of this, I didn’t really find speaking English quite hard growing up. After all, growing up, I was in front of the TV watching these cartoons on Disney channel, along with other shows on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Also because of this habit, I had eyesight problems and started wearing glasses the entirety of my Grade School life. In 6th grade, I started watching anime, namely Naruto<sup>5</sup> and Pokemon<sup>6</sup> This is when I realized that the two games I played were so much more than just games. We also continued our Journalism activities for the school and entered the contest as well for that year. Funny enough, I won my part in Editorial Cartooning, becoming <strong>first place and becoming Manila City’s representative in the NCR competition</strong>, which unfortunately, I did not win. But hey, one time is enough so I guess it’s alright. Also, I graduated elementary with honors. Not really surprising since the top 10 in class rarely changes. What’s surprising about it is I got the award “Huwarang Mag Aaral” which is basically given to  the person in the top 10 who was the most “virtuous”. I guess I still was’t corrupted back then.

    <h2>HIGHSCHOOL</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us now move on to my Highschool days then. I was enrolled in the Florentino Torres Highschool and took my Junior High there. I actually don’t remember much from my 7th grade and 8th grade. Just because it was so mundane and that nothing really happened there. Well except for I made three really great friends that I keep going back two even if we got separated by blocks throughout the other grades. We occasionally get in touch with each other as well through our group chat even now. The funny thing is that it’s still about the same thing. Studies and Games. Mainly Pokemon. That’s right, throughout my Junior high days, the one thing that significantly became part of my life is Anime and Pokemon. I talked about how I started watching Naruto in my elementary school days, but eventually, I caught up to the latest episode, and started reading the Manga, which is also the first manga I've ever read. And at the same time, I started watching other anime series. At school, we often play Pokemon, not on the Gameboy but emulators we installed on our phones. We played most of the available Pokemon games that time. We only had very crappy smartphones back then, but no matter how crappy it is, it was powerful enough to play games that were released in the 1990s and early 2000s. I can’t emphasize enough how this became the biggest part of my life during this time. I was a weeb, we were weebs, we were geeks, we were geeks before being a geek was cool. Because of this, we were actually treated like outcasts. This was the majority of my junior high life. Not until we got to the 9th grade and 10th grade that I slowly became more social. I’d say it was thanks to a very few friends that are more normies yet accepting of people like me that found a way to interact more with other people. Thinking about it, I really am glad that watching anime and playing games like Pokemon became more mainstream even with kids and less of a thing that only geeks do. At Least this way, less kids may have to go through my experiences. During the 10th grade, some notable things that happened was that one of my close friends at that time and I collaborated on a science project that was entered through a national science fair called <abbr title="REGIONAL INVENTION CONTEST AND EXHIBIT">RICE</abbr> held annually by the <abbr title="DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY">DOST</abbr>. We didn’t win, but I was just glad that we got to join the exhibits and saw a lot of great science projects not just by junior highschool students like us but by college students as well that participated. Another notable thing is that friend that I mentioned was also my partner when we joined the first Manila Robotics tournament. It was also one of the biggest regrets I had.The contest was to make your robot run through a prepared course at the shortest possible time. The problem was on the first lap, we misplaced the robot’s censor and wasn’t able to start due to not being able to sense that start line. The second lap however was a success and that it became the lap shortest time out of everyone. But since we failed the first lap, we lost anyway. That’s about it for my junior highschool, oh and I also met my best friend there. Moving on to Senior High School, I got enrolled in the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila and studied for two years there. I would say that those two years were the best highschool years I’ve ever had. The block I got assigned to was full of very good people of different characters. I had made a lot of good memories there, ups and downs where I truly experienced being myself and made a lot of good friends and since my best friend also got to enroll there, all’s well that ends well.

    <h2>COLLEGE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; College life is something that I consider the craziest moment of my life. Craziest is not often a good thing, unfortunately, that applies to me as well. Don’t get me wrong, I experienced a lot of things that I could say were valuable in my life. But during these times, I have also experienced things that I could say I did not want to experience ever. Right now, as I am writing this thing, I could say that I am having a hard time thinking of what I should say. After all, a lot of things happened in my private life that are too much for me to publicly write here. So instead, let me go through various noteworthy things that happened in my school life here in UE as an IT student. I am an irregular student here, I enrolled at the second semester of the school year 2018. I had some experience in programming, like for example, that time when I participated in the robotics tournament. Maybe because of that, I adjusted in my programming subjects quite well. And in other subjects learning about basics of computer technologies and such, I would say I did quite well as well considering that in the last few years, I’ve watched daily uploads from LTT and other related channels everyday, giving me some knowledge that otherwise, regular people won’t have. I made some very good friends in my first semester, some of which I am still classmates of. Due to being part of other courses though, some of those friends I do not see often now. In my second semester here, my friend and I got enrolled in a class about art appreciation, where we two were the only IT students among a class of Civil Engineering students. The reason I’m telling you this is because for our final project there, we needed to construct a model building, and the Avengers Tower replica we created got the highest grade in the entire class. Yes, I am bragging about that. Being an irregular student, we were often placed in classes among other sections of students, a lot of times from other courses as well. Because of that, we met quite a few people here in UE where otherwise we wouldn't if we were normal students. I also took ROTC here in UE. That was quite an experience. Standing straight up in the middle of the afternoon where the Sun is directly above you with no clouds to shadows you in. Being of legal age as well, I had my first drinking party in college. Not bad, I’m just there for the food to be honest. College, I would say, is really a point in where you start thinking of what you should do and what you should be not just as a person, but as a proper adult. But I would say this is currently the biggest point of my life, and I am just hoping that I will overcome this at some point.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you made here in the end, I would like to say thank you to those who may be reading this. Writing this really gave me a great sense of nostalgia, bringing back both good and bad memories, and even made me think of where I am right now.  If you had read the whole thing, thank you very much, I honestly can’t believe you did that. I am sorry for making you suffer through my writing. If you did not read all of that, don’t worry, I don’t think I would either.
