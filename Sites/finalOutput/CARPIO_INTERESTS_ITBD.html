    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Hobbies, I would say, really take up the majority of life right now. What is it you ask? <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">Anime</a>, Manga, Novels, and maybe drawing(I would put this on skills so scroll down to read more on that or click here). I first watched Anime in my elementary school days. Back then, I watched <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a><img src="https://Carpio-ITBD.github.io/Images/NarutoCoverTankobon1.jpg" class="image" title="NARUTO VOLUME 1 FRONT COVER"> due to a recommendation from a friend. Before I knew it, I watched all available episodes and learned what a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">manga</a> is, in order to continue watching, or in this case, reading the story. Before I knew it, I was also watching other anime series starting from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokemon</a>, going to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakugan_Battle_Brawlers">Bakugan</a> (Because it was on TV), then started watching some more real anime, otaku, whatever you want to call it stuff. From romance anime like <a target="_blank" href="myanimelist">Golden Time</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toradora!">Toradora</a>, to Sci Fi and Fantasy ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Horizon">Log Horizon</a> and various <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam#TV_series,_films,_and_video">Gundam series</a>. <img src="https://Carpio-ITBD.github.io/Images/MobileSuitGundamDVDbox.jpg"  class="imageR" title="MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM DVD COVER"> Even a few series that I didn’t know at the time, were quite unknown and were hidden gems like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_of_the_East">Eden of the East</a>. The point is, this became what majorly encompases my highschool life, yes, both junior and senior high. There is a website that a lot of otakus like me, actually uses to track the series that we watch and rate them. Though in my case, I don’t really use it now quite often. But for writing this piece, I decided to open my account and see the listed anime and see my stats, and it says that I have a total of <mark>54.88 Days</mark> in watch time. I thought that was quite low, and you may have thought too, but let’s convert it to hours. That’s a total of <mark>one thousand three hundred seventeen(1,317) HOURS and 7 minutes</mark> . It's composed of 86 series plus 31 movies plus other OVAs and Specials. But that’s just anime, so let’s talk about manga. Manga is something I can confidently say that I have spent more time reading than watching anime, which as I already established, is a lot of time. By browsing on the current app I use to read manga and webtoons, it shows that I follow about 300 different series plus quite a lot more for the series that I have dropped or haven’t started reading. There’s also the Light Novels with <mark>74 volumes</mark> that I have read, and the Web Novels with who knows how much I’ve read as well. Currently, I am reading far more than watching. I think I’ve only watched a couple anime last year compared to the dozens of Manga and Novel series I’ve read. So yeah, that’s a bit of a peek into my hobby!

<!--SKILLS-->
<div name="divParagraph2" class="main">
    <h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #33cc00;">MY SKILL<s>S</s></h2>
        <hr>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        I couldn’t say I really have a skill that is noteworthy. But if I’m really gonna pull my leg, I would say that I can draw a little bit. When I was young, I remember copying various arts that I would see around me. For example, I would often draw the illustration I see on my school bag, notebook, lunchbox, and other stuff. This was between 2005 and 2012 and at that time, or maybe it was because it’s all kid stuff, but a lot of the items are decorated with these cartoons and anime. That's what got me to drawing. When I was in grade 5 and 6, I was part of the journalism group of our school. Obviously, since I am talking about drawing here, I have the role of editorial journalism assigned to me. In the city wide competition in my 6th grade, I won first place and got to represent Manila in the <abbr title="NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION">NCR</abbr> competition(did not win tho). Unfortunately, over the time, I did not manage to further my skills in drawing. I got busy in school and other things. I still draw when I get an opportunity. For example, when I get an assignment in class to make a poster. Or when the assignment calls for story telling, I do make little comics and such. However, right now, I now do occasionally practice drawing. It’s not as much as I would have hope too, but scheduling issues and such. I do, however, really want to improve this skill. So whenever I can, I draw. Right now, the art I draw are mostly fanarts of my favorite vtubers or anime characters. I do post them on Twitter but on an alternate account using a different name. So unfortunately, I can’t show it here for privacy reasons XD.

<!--INTERESTS-->
<div name="divParagraph3" class="main">
    <h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #33cc00;">MY INTERESTS</h2>
        <hr>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        My interest can be seen from what I discussed later at my hobbies and skills. In fact, my interests are just my hobbies. My hobbies, skills, and interests are like 3 sides of a triangle, all in one entity. I can say that aside from what I discussed in both the Hobbies and Interest paragraphs, another interest of mine that I can elaborate on is Tech. Tech has been a very great part of my life growing up. I don’t really mean like I have a lot of gadgets and computers, in fact, I could honestly say I have less than others. My interest lies in the topic itself. Building computers and new technologies that can be seen in consumer gadgets, etc. Even now, I spend a good portion of my time watching tech videos on youtube everyday. From daily uploads of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips" title="LINUS TECH TIPS">LTT</a> to the not so often uploads of their other channels like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeFfhMcJa1kjtfZAGskOCA">TechLinked</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdBK94H6oZT2Q7l0-b0xmMg">ShortCircuit</a>. I mainly watch channels from this <a target="_blank" href="https://linusmediagroup.com/">media group</a> because their content is more inclined to what I like, more tech savvy stuff than your normal normie know-how. I find it very interesting seeing the new technologies being created by various tech giants to little startups. But that is not all, as much as I like those, I could say that what I find as much as interesting as those are the current happenings that transpire in the tech world. Like political stuff between companies and government, or disputes and standoffs between these tech giants.It’s actually unbelievable how much of these things are happening yet not reported in the local news of our country and it’s very fascinating for me. When I started getting more updated into these things, like in the later part of my junior highschool days, I started seeing the tech industry in a new light compared to how others see it. I can’t say if that light is more in a good one or a bad one, but being more informed in this kind of stuff honestly has become quite a blessing for me. This interest of mine has become so prominent in my life that it is just there, part of my everyday. It also allowed me to view my other interest in a new light. It also actually helped me find my other interest like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">vtubers</a> and other such tech related entertainment.
